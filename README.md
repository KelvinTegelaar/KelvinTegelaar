### Hi there 👋

I'm Kelvin Tegelaar, Also known as "Lime" or Lime-TeGek" in some parts. I enjoy long walks on github pages and PowerShelling a lot.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ... My PowerShell blogs on https://cyberdrain.com
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ... Any project I have on my Github. I love collabing!
- 💬 Ask me about PowerShell, Monitoring, Automation, and how much fun it is to run a MSP.
- 📫 How to reach me: kelvin {at} cyberdrain.com or twitter @KelvinTegelaar
- ⚡ Fun fact: I specialize in monitoring using RMM systems, they actually are a big hobby of mine. This is also why I like speaking at events such as Dattocon, Solarwinds Empower MSP :)
- 😁I'm proud of the following projects:
    - my [RunAsUser](https://github.com/KelvinTegelaar/RunAsUser) Module, which allows you to execute scripts as the currently logged on user, while the script host was started as SYSTEM.
    - My [AutotaskAPI](https://github.com/KelvinTegelaar/AutotaskAPI) project for creating a fast method of connecting to the REST API
    - My Automatic Documentation blogs, as I strongly believe that automatic documentation is the only correct documentation.
    - And a lot more projects to mention here... :)
