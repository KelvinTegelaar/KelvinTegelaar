### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kelvin Tegelaar, Also known as "Lime" or Lime-TeGek" in some parts. I enjoy long walks on github pages and PowerShelling a lot.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ... My PowerShell blogs on https://cyberdrain.com
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ... Any project I have on my Github. I love collabing!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about PowerShell, Monitoring, Automation, and how much fun it is to run a MSP.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: kelvin {at} cyberdrain.com or twitter @KelvinTegelaar
- âš¡ Fun fact: I specialize in monitoring using RMM systems, they actually are a big hobby of mine. This is also why I like speaking at events such as Dattocon, Solarwinds Empower MSP :)
